# Login/Logout Spring boot app

Very simple app with login and logout capabilities. App was made via Laur's Spilca ["Spring Start Here - Learn what you need and learn it well"](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-start-here)

Very good book for people starting to learn Spring and Spring boot. Covers all basic topics, doesn't go into random details and explains everything in basic allegories AND uses **Maven** instead of the god forsaken ~Gradle~...

# That's it!

P.S This is the time I finally learned how to format README's :)
